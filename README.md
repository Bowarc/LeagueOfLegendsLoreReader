This is a project that is supposed to take as input the language and the League of Legend champion taht you want, and read it's lore to you.

The problem is that i can't find a cool tts crate in rust, and the google traduction voice is not very pleasing to hear for more than ~10 seconds.

Soo it's in a pause rn, feel free to take this code and modify it as you want.
